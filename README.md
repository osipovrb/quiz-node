# About
This is a simple chat-based quiz where the host (bot) asks questions and awards points for correct answers. Players are given a limited amount of time to respond. If a player struggles to answer, the host provides hints.

This repository serves as the backend for the quiz. Using the "console" IO adapter implementation, the game is designed for a single player, whereas with the "http" implementation, the game becomes multiplayer.

# Usage
TBD
